			<h2>Why Walk?</h2>
		</div>
		<h3>The Problem:</h3><br/>
		<p>It's the last leg of your commute, you're two blocks from your destination, maybe you're even in the building already. Now what? Until today you'd have to <em>walk</em> those last couple blocks, <em>climb</em> that flight of stairs, or <em> push</em> that button on the elevator like a <em>barbarian</em>. </p>
		<h3>The Solution:</h3><br/>
		<p>Thanks to Human Bixie, your troubles are over. Our dedicated service professionals <em>(mulemen &copy;)</em> will carry you the rest of the way! You don't have to lift a finger.   </p>

				<h3> FAQ'S </h3></br>
				<dl>
		
						<dt> You say on your site that I don't have to lift a finger, but wouldn't I have to jump on the muleman's back? </dt>
						<dd> Nope! Our mulemen are specially trained to handle your person like the lazy, delicate being you are. Just stand in place and let them do all the work! <dd>
					
					
						<dt> Is there a limit on how many stairs we can ask them to climb? </dt>
						<dd>there is no limit on what kind of terrain you can ask your muleman to traverse, but for your own comfort, you might want to put a towel between you and them on those extra long hikes.</dd>
					
						<dt>Am I allowed to feed the muleman?</dt>
						<dd>we ask that you do not feed them, as we don't know what you put in your brownies</dd>

					<p>getting to class has never been easier! I have a muleman pick me up from each class and drop me off at the next one! Thanks Human Bixie!</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>I used to walk into people and objects on my way to class everyday. I wasn't sure if it was because I was texting or because I suck at walking, but I didn't want to stop looking at my phone to figure it out. I started reserving mulemen online and I haven't walked into anything since!</p>
